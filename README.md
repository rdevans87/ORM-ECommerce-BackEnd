# ORM-ECommerce-BackEnd


## Description 

This project was developed using starter code to create a back-end application for an e-commerce site that uses the command line interface (CLI) and object-relational mapping for various methods of data manipulation, storage, and retrieval when using HTTP methods with a RESTUL API.  

The `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder was run in `MySQL Workbench` to create the `ecommerce_db` and establish a connection with `Insomnia Core` through the command line interface (CLI). Once the database is created, the specific `NPM packages` are installed using `npm i`. 
[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect an `Express.js` API to a MySQL database, which utilizes the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to store sensitive environmental variables such as: `username`, `password`, and `database name`. `npm run seed` command migrates the data to MYSQL. A table is created out of the four objects located in the models folder: `Product`, `Category`, `Tag`, `ProductTag`.

With the `node.js` packages installed and database seeded without error, run `NPM Start` to start the server and connect to local host [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/). Then, an API GET request is performed for each route displaying in JSON format. All API `POST, PUT, and DELETE` routes are tested in Insomnia Core. I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

```
## Installation/Usage

From the command line, run:

`npm init`

`npm install mysql2`

`npm install sequelize`

`npm install express`

`npm install dotenv`

`npm run start`


## Mock-Up
The following animation shows the application's GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for `TAGS` being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET tag by ID" ,and “PUT update Tag" , "DELETE Tag by ID" , "POST create New Tag”.](./assets/categories.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for `CATEGORIES` being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests "GET Categories", “GET Categories by ID”, “PUT update Category", "DELETE category by ID", "POST create category".](./assets/categories.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for `PRODUCTS` being tested in Insomnia Core:
