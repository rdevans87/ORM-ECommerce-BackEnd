# ORM-ECommerce-BackEnd

## Description 

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Your database should contain the following four models `Category`, `Product`, `Tag`, `Product Tag`.  Execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:


## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia Core:

![In Insomnia Core, the user tests “DELETE Category by ID,” “CREATE Category,” and “UPDATE Category.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-03.gif)

Your walkthrough video should also show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia Core.
 

### Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations

Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

Note that the functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products has already been completed for you.

> **Hint**: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!

### Seed the Database

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

### Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.

## Grading Requirements

This homework is graded based on the following criteria: 

### Deliverables: 10%

* The GitHub repository containing your application code. 

### Walkthrough Video: 37%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the e-commerce back end must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your readme file.

* The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to create the schema from the MySQL shell.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to seed the database from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application’s server.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia Core.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia Core.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Connects to a MySQL database using the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages.

  * Stores sensitive data, like a user’s MySQL username, password, and database name, using environment variables through the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package.

  * Syncs Sequelize models to a MySQL database on the server start.

  * Includes column definitions for all four models outlined in the homework instructions. 

  * Includes model associations outlined in the homework instructions.
